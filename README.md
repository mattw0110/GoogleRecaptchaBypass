# Google Recaptcha Solver

**We love bots ‚ù§Ô∏è, but Google doesn't.** So, here is the solution to bypass Google reCAPTCHA.

Solve Google reCAPTCHA less than 5 seconds! üöÄ

This is a Python script to solve Google reCAPTCHA using the DrissionPage library. *~~Selenium implementation will be added soon.~~*

## Recent Updates

Good news! Selenium implementation is added. Thanks to [@obaskly](https://github.com/obaskly) for the contribution. Check out the [selenium branch](https://github.com/sarperavci/GoogleRecaptchaBypass/tree/selenium) for more details.

## Installation
Three dependencies are required to run this script. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you need to install ffmpeg. You can download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

To implement this script in your project, you can follow a similar approach as shown below:

```python
from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage 
from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver
driver = ChromiumPage()
recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)
driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()
```

I have created `test.py` to demonstrate the usage of this script. You can run the `test.py` file to see the script in action.


## Demo

## How does it work?

We automate the browser to solve the reCAPTCHA. Instead of image captcha, we are solving the audio captcha. The audio captcha is easier to solve programmatically.

**One warning:** Google may block your IP if you solve too many captchas in a short period of time. So, use this script wisely or change your IP frequently.
